               <p class="format"><i>What a horrible discovery!</i> The great Zephyr had returned from it's tour of the Shining North Seas and Nutt Penguin, the Boatswain on deck, spotted the Clawz Naval Base; it had been laid to waste! It was that day that the intrepid Captain Kitty vowed revenge!</p>

             <p class="format">The hunt was on for the Evil Dogertons. Captain Kitty was certain it was they, for the destruction had their muddy paw print all over it. He decided to get information about any suspicious activity that may lead to the grave Dogerton pirate Spotted Sam from Lady Anathema, the mis-understood Mistress of Kitten-Brulee â€“ a house of ill repute! She opened her bourdoir to him tempting him with catnip treats, but the brave captain refused with a thought toward his sweet Miss Katz, Lady Kiterton, the fair mistress of Felix Estates and his loving fiancee.</p>
             <p class="format">Anathema was coy, but Captain Kitty was resolute. "You will tell me!" he demanded. She fluttered her eyes and replied, "There's nothing to say really..." She paused and said, "Though I have heard of some dogish activities at a certain opium den at the heart of the Kitty Litter district should I get the right incentive to say so."</p>
